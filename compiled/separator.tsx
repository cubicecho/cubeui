 * This is level 4 of the plan: the item has a hand-written web half, so nothing was generated. The
 * same passes still ran over it, and for a file already written against the DOM they find nothing
 * to do beyond pointing its sibling imports at the web tree. That is deliberate — running one
 * pipeline over the whole output tree is what guarantees a hand-written half and a compiled one
 * speak the same prop vocabulary, instead of the two drifting where nobody is looking.
