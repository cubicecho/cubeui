/**
 * A small selectable pill — a filter chip, a day-of-week toggle, a swatch.
 *
 * Distinct from `segmented` in what the selection means: a segmented control is
 * one-of-N and its items are a closed set, a chip is on/off and stands alone.
 * Colour is split across the container and the `<Text>` for the usual reason:
 * native does not inherit it.
 *
 * **Takes the rest of a `Pressable`'s props and forwards a ref**, the same
 * contract `button.tsx` has. It did not, and the closed prop set is what a
 * caller hits first: a chip explaining why it is off wants a tooltip, and
 * `<TooltipTrigger asChild>` clones its child with a ref and a handful of
 * `aria-*` and pointer props. A component that declares neither drops all of
 * them — silently, since the props go nowhere rather than erroring — so the
 * tooltip never opens and the chip never gets the description. The same is
 * true of `onLongPress`, `testID`, and every other prop the platform has and
 * this file had not thought to list.
