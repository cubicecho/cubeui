/**
 * Copied from `registry/ui/textarea.web.tsx` by `scripts/rn2web`.
 * Do not edit — edit the source and re-run `npm run compile`.
 *
 * This is level 4 of the plan: the item has a hand-written web half, so nothing was generated. The
 * same passes still ran over it, and for a file already written against the DOM they find nothing
 * to do beyond pointing its sibling imports at the web tree. That is deliberate — running one
 * pipeline over the whole output tree is what guarantees a hand-written half and a compiled one
 * speak the same prop vocabulary, instead of the two drifting where nobody is looking.
 */

/**
 * The web implementation — see `textarea.tsx` for why this one is split, and
 * `textarea-base.ts` for the contract both sides implement.
 *
 * It is hand-written rather than compiled because nothing `TextInput` does here
 * survives a rename table: `editable={!disabled}` inverts, `onChangeText(text)`
 * and `onChange(event)` are different signatures, and the element itself depends
 * on the value of `multiline`. Each of those is the compiler guessing at
 * semantics the source never stated, which is the one thing it is built not to
 * do — so it refuses, and this file is the answer it asks for.
 *
 * **It is also shadcn's `Textarea`.** It installs over a DOM app's own
 * `components/ui/textarea.tsx`, so it takes everything a `<textarea>` does —
 * `onChange(event)` beside `onChangeText`, `name`, `defaultValue`, the key and
 * focus handlers, a `ref` to the element — and a `value` left out is left
 * uncontrolled, as it is on the DOM. (The native half holds a missing value at
 * `""`; a bound field passes one either way.)
