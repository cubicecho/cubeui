/**
 * One confirmation prompt for both platforms.
 *
 * The two idioms this replaces are a dialog per call site with its own `open`
 * state on web, and `Alert.alert` with a hand-written cancel/destructive pair on
 * native. Both become `useConfirm()`, which resolves a promise:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const confirm = useConfirm();
 * if (await confirm({ title: "Delete list?", description: "…" })) remove();
 * ```
 *
 * The dialog closes as soon as the choice is made, so the in-flight state
 * belongs to whatever the caller does next — a row that greys itself out while
 * its mutation runs, not a button inside a prompt the user already dismissed.
