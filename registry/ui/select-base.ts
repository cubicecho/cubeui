 * shadcn's compiles against either half. The types below are the part that means
 * the same on both platforms; the web half widens each to radix's own props
 * (`name`, `required`, `dir`, `position`, `textValue`, a trigger's `size` and
 * every `<button>` attribute), because it installs over a DOM app's shadcn
 * select. The two scroll buttons render nothing on native: a sheet scrolls by
