/**
 * The native switch: a `Pressable` track with a thumb that moves, rather than
 * react-native's `Switch`. RN's takes `trackColor`/`thumbColor` as raw colour
 * values, which would pin the control outside the tailwind theme and make it
 * the one control that does not follow dark mode with the rest.
 *
 * `switch.web.tsx` is radix; `switch-base.ts` holds the contract and the track
 * classes, so the two cannot drift visually.
