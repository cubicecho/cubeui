/**
 * The icon set, web implementation — see `icons.tsx` for the native one and why
 * this module exists at all.
 *
 * Web needs no wrapper: an `<svg>` already takes `className`, and its colour
 * comes from `currentColor` on the container, hover states included. Pinning a
 * colour here — the way the native file has to — would break exactly that. So
 * this is a plain re-export (and an `icon` that wraps nothing), and the barrel is fine because the web bundler does
 * tree-shake.
 *
 * The exported names must stay in step with `icons.tsx`. TypeScript will not
 * check it, because it only ever resolves the native file; `scripts/check-registry-build.mjs`
 * does.
