/**
 * A loading indicator: the `LoaderCircle` glyph, turning. `spinner.web.tsx` is
 * the web counterpart and `spinner-base.ts` holds what they share.
 *
 * Not `ActivityIndicator`. That one draws the platform's own spinner, which is
 * a different shape on iOS, on Android and in the browser, and takes a colour
 * prop but no class. This is the same glyph the web half turns, sized and
 * coloured by `className` through `@cubeui/icons` — so inside a `Button` it
 * takes the button's ink from `IconClassContext`, as any icon there does.
 *
 * The turn is `Animated` on the native driver, one linear turn a second, which
 * is Tailwind's `animate-spin`. The compiler refuses `Animated`, which is why
 * the web half is hand-written rather than compiled from this file.
