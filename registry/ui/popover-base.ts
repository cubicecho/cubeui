 * The contract `popover.tsx` (native) and `popover.web.tsx` (radix) both

 * to `popover.web.tsx` on web, so the web file cannot import shared types from
 * `./popover` without importing itself.
 *
 * Narrower than radix's props on purpose: an `asChild` trigger and one content
 * pane. That is the shape both platforms can honour — everything radix offers
 * beyond it (collision handling, side flipping, a separate anchor) has no native
 * counterpart. The web half accepts it all the same, on top of this contract,
 * because it is a drop-in for shadcn's `popover`: `popover.web.tsx` widens each
 * part to the radix part it renders. Those extras are web only, and on native a
 * `PopoverAnchor` simply renders its children.
